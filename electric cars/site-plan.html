      <p>
        The benefits of electric cars are numerous. For one, electric cars are much more 
        efficient than traditional gasoline-powered cars. Because the electric motor is 
        so much more efficient than the internal combustion engine, electric cars can go 
        further on a single charge, which means that you'll save money on fuel costs in 
        the long run. Additionally, electric cars produce zero emissions, which means that
        they are much better for the environment. This is important, as air pollution from 
        gasoline-powered cars is a major contributor to climate change.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Colored paragraph example
      </h3>
      <p class="colored">
        Another advantage of electric cars is that they are much quieter than gasoline-powered 
        cars. This is great for people who live in urban areas, as it means that you won't have 
        to deal with the noise of a loud engine. Additionally, because electric cars don't 
        produce emissions, they don't produce the smelly exhaust that gasoline-powered cars do.
        This means that you'll be able to enjoy a fresher, cleaner air when you're driving your 
        electric car.
